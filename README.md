# Bird-Species-Detection-using-CNN-and-EfficientNet-B0
This project aims to detect bird species using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with EfficientNet-B0 architecture, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model for image classification tasks. The dataset used for training and testing the model contains images of various bird species.

# Dataset Dscription
The dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/code/vencerlanz09/bird-classification-using-cnn-efficientnetb0) consists of images of different bird species collected from kaggle. Each image is labeled with the corresponding bird species. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the CNN model.

# Instructions to Run
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, EfficientNet, NumPy, and any additional libraries specified in the project.
Download the dataset and organize it into appropriate directories such as train and test folders, with each subfolder representing a different bird species.
Execute the Python script for training and testing the CNN model using EfficientNet-B0 architecture.
After training, evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset and observe the accuracy and other relevant metrics.
# Results
The performance of the CNN model using EfficientNet-B0 architecture will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results will provide insights into the effectiveness of the model in detecting various bird species.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the application of Convolutional Neural Networks, particularly with the EfficientNet-B0 architecture, for bird species detection. By leveraging deep learning techniques, we aim to achieve accurate identification of bird species from images, which can have various practical applications in wildlife conservation, research, and birdwatching.
